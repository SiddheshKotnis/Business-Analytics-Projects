Retail Transactions Dashboard:
An interactive Power BI dashboard analysing an e‑commerce retailer’s performance across sales, products, customer segments, and operations. It highlights key drivers of revenue and reveals bottlenecks in the order pipeline and payments to support data‑driven decisions.

Why the dashboard exists:
The dashboard exists to give leadership a reliable view of how the e‑commerce business is performing over the last 12 months. Its purpose is to surface the key patterns in revenue, orders, customers, products, and operations that are hard to see in raw tables. By consolidating these metrics, it helps managers quickly see what is driving growth and where issues in fulfilment or customer value may be holding the business back

Techstack used:
Power BI Desktop: Main data visualisation platform used for report creation
Power BI Service: Hosted the published report and enabled interactive sharing via a web link.
Power Query: Performed data cleaning, transformation, and loading into the model.
Excel: Used for initial data exploration and minor preprocessing before importing into Power BI.

DASHBOARD INSIGHTS

1) Revenue & Sales Performance Snapshot: 
   - Revenue is stable around 6.3–6.5M per month with a noticeable dip in February 2024, suggesting either a seasonal low or an emerging slowdown that should be investigated before it becomes a trend.

2) Category & Product Profitability Insights:
   - Electronics and Grocery clearly outperform other categories in revenue while maintaining similar average order values, indicating that demand rather than price is the main driver. These should be priority categories for inventory allocation and marketing spend, and they could increase their prices depending on their price elasticity.
   - Electronics demonstrates proportional performance where its highest rating (3.27) aligns with top revenue (18.2M), reflecting strong customer preference driving sales. Clothing, however, maintains high revenue (13.9M) despite the lowest rating (3.10), indicating persistent demand that leadership can capitalise on by resolving quality issues to boost loyalty and repeat purchases.

3) Customer Segment Value & Growth:
   - Premium customers occupy the lowest quadrant on both total orders and revenue, indicating the segment fails to justify its likely higher acquisition or servicing costs compared to Regulars. Meanwhile, Regulars lead in both areas, making them the main driver of business growth that deserves more focus on keeping them happy and buying more.
   - New customers start with the highest average revenue per customer (~5.9K), beating Regulars (~4.7K), but their spending drops once they become regulars. Executives should find out why and use simple re-engagement offers to keep their spending high.
  
4) Order Pipeline & Payment Methods:
   - The top 4 states (NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia) drive significantly more orders than the rest, with a sharp decline visible from the 5th state onward, even among the top 7 shown. This geographic skew highlights opportunities to optimise logistics and marketing spend in these high-volume regions.
